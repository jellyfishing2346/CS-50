# Top Schools
#### Video Demo:  < https://youtu.be/i1hVyVv14CM >
 Description: I designed a program that deals with which top school is the best.
The schools are Yale and Darmouth.
File Description:
    The finals.py is to get the user's id.The app.py is to check the login information of the user such as their
username and password. If it exists for either the username then print
its already existed. If they enter the wrong username or password print
its incorrect. Also to check their email and other personal information
to see if its not being used. The index html is to link the webpages to the
three top schools Harvard, Yale, and Darmouth. For the webpage to Harvard
is harvard.html, Yale is to yale.html, Darmouth is to darmouth.hthml.
I also included their pictures for the user to see.
Reason:
    I chose to make it to determine which school has more opportunities after
 gradueating high school. The facts are to talk about the cool stuff such as
 Yale President Ezra Stiles led more than half of the student body.
 As for Darmouth expanded the landscapes for education,
agriculture, and improve life for the Indian tribes.
 Overall the goal is to expand their knowledge for a
 fellow educator.
