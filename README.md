# Top Schools
#### Video Demo:  < https://youtu.be/i1hVyVv14CM >
 Description: I designed a program that deals with which top school is the best.
The schools are Yale and Darmouth.
File Description:
    The finals.py is to get the user's id.The app.py is to check the login information of the user such as their
username and password. If it exists for either the username then print
its already existed. If they enter the wrong username or password print
its incorrect. Also to check their email and other personal information
to see if its not being used. The index html is to link the webpages to the
three top schools Harvard, Yale, and Darmouth. For the webpage to Harvard
is harvard.html, Yale is to yale.html, Darmouth is to darmouth.hthml.
I also included their pictures for the user to see.
Reason:
    I chose to make it to determine which school has more opportunities after
 gradueating high school. The facts are to talk about the cool stuff such as
 Yale President Ezra Stiles led more than half of the student body.
 As for Darmouth expanded the landscapes for education,
agriculture, and improve life for the Indian tribes.
For Harvard for its years of slavery towards to African Americans in the Massachusetts.
 Overall the goal is to expand their knowledge for a
 fellow educator.
 Harvard:
             During the antebellum era, well after the end of slavery in Massachusetts, and even after the 13th Amendment
              to the US Constitution conferred emancipation nationwide in 1865, vestiges—or legacies—of the system lingered.
              Legacies of slavery such as exclusion, segregation, and discrimination against Blacks in employment, voting,
              housing, healthcare, public accommodations, criminal punishment, and education, among other areas, persisted
              in the South as well as the North.⁠Go to footnote 38 detail Notwithstanding the Commonwealth’s Revolutionary War
              heritage as birthplace of the colonists’ struggle for liberty, its celebrated antislavery activists,
              and its many brave Union veterans of the Civil War,
              ⁠Go to footnote 39 detail racial inequality flourished in Massachusetts—and at Harvard—as Blacks
              struggled for equal opportunity and full citizenship. I am listing the history of slavery that the institute was once apart of.
 Yale:
             Yale’s connections to the military have been long-standing.
             Yale President Ezra Stiles led more than half of the student body
             to take on the overwhelming Redcoat troops in 1779 when the largest flotilla ever to enter
             Long Island Sound attacked New Haven. Twenty-five Yale graduates served as Generals for the
             Union Army during the Civil War, and almost 9,500 Yale graduates and students served in World War I.
             During World War II, the campus was largely given over to the military, and over 20,000 soldiers,
             sailors and marines were trained on campus at Yale.
             In addition to basic training, Yale hosted the Army Specialized Training Program, the Navy’s V-12 program,
             the Army Air Forces Technical Training School and a Military Intelligence School.
 Darmouth:
              Dartmouth's root system weaves through many pivotal moments in the history of the United States.
              Founded in 1769, the College has shaped the education landscape and prepared generations of leaders to
              advance industries, societies, and cultures.
              Dartmouth's founder, Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister from Connecticut,
              established the College "for the education and instruction of youth of the Indian tribes in this land...
              English Youth, and any others." Samson Occom, a Mohegan Indian and one of Wheelock's first students,
              was instrumental in raising the funds necessary to found the College/
