# Top Schools
#### Video Demo:  < https://youtu.be/i1hVyVv14CM >
#### Description: I designed a program that deals with which top school is the best.
### The schools are Yale and Darmouth. Also which school is the best.
### I chose to make it to determine which school has more opportunities after
### gradueating high school. The facts are to talk about the cool stuff such as
### Yale President Ezra Stiles led more than half of the student body.
### As for Darmouth expanded the landscapes for education,
## agriculture, and improve life for the Indian tribes.
### Overall the goal is to expand their knowledge for a
### fellow educator.
