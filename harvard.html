              During the antebellum era, well after the end of slavery in Massachusetts, and even after the 13th Amendment
              to the US Constitution conferred emancipation nationwide in 1865, vestiges—or legacies—of the system lingered.

              housing, healthcare, public accommodations, criminal punishment, and education, among other areas, persisted

              Harvard's first-ever Global Day of Service expands on an annual Harvard College orientation event
              that welcomes first year students to their new communities of Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville through service.
              Through this program we engage a broad range of students, community partners, faculty, staff, and alumni will work
              together to support virtual volunteer projects.  This community-wide effort introduces incoming first-year students
              to a vibrant culture of public service programs at Harvard. Throughout this program, we will highlight several ways
              that all participants can stay civically engaged throughout the year.
              The Global Day of Service unites students, staff, faculty, alums, and community partners around a shared purpose.
