							One fact is that many of the students have earned the Pulitzer
							prizes. Another fact is that a harvard alum named Dr. George
							Parkman was murdered by Harvard professor Webster. The reason was
							over Parkman lent money to Webster, but Webster didn't pay him
							back. Parkman's burnt body was in Webster's lab which during the
							trial was the first time forensic antropology to be used in a
							court case. The third fact is about the three lies of the
							founder's statue. The first lie is that the founder is not John
							Harvard, but he was a major benefactor. The second lie is that the
							institution is founed in 1636 not 1638. The third lie is the
							sculpture of a random student not John Harvard.

							One fact is that a Yale graduate named Nathan Hale(worst spy)
							uttered the phrase "I only regret that I have but one life to lose
							to my country. The institution created a statue for the patriot,
							so the CIA tried to buy the statue but the institution refused. So
							the agents broke in to make a mold cast to replicate the statue
							while others swap the original with a decoy. Another fact is that
							the CIA spy network is constructed by Yale graduates to help
							enhance their technology. A third fact is the institution has a
							secret society called Skull and Bones where rumor claims they
							stole the skull of a Native American name Geronimo after
							descreating a Native American burial ground.
