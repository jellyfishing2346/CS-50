The issue is now that stockName is not defined

@app.route("/quote", methods=["GET", "POST"])
@login_required
def quote():

    if request.method == "POST":
        quotes = lookup(request.form.get("symbol"))

sorry i was afk
show me the error message? are you getting past the previous invald ticker one?
because yeah, stockname has no assigned variable
you'll  need to do something like stockname = lockup(request.form.get("stock"))
or something
in your sql database, you'll want at least 2 tables, one is the premade users, the other is for the transactions user does ##sidenote i'm still on this pset, and adding features, so maybe 3 tables could be used but for now i'm just doing two##
so in your second table (that you made) you'll have all the user info, what they own, cash, etc
in there you'd want to take the name of a specific stock i think

i feel i may just be making this worse tbh lmao
like in my quote html, i have the name of the value as stock
<input autocomplete="off" autofocus class="form-control mx-auto w-auto" id="symbol" name="symbol" placeholder="Symbol" type="text">
sorry symbol
if request.method == "POST":
        symbol = request.form.get("symbol")

        if not symbol:
            return apology("Please input a symbol")

        stock = lookup(symbol)

        if not stock:
            return apology("Symbol isn't valid")
        return render_template("quoted.html", stock = stock)
    else:
        return render_template("quote.html")
then only that for my python code for quote

quotes = request.form.get("symbol").upper()

my bad, it want's the upper function bc the symbol names are all capitalized

I didn't format the price of stock by usd(). When I changed my code from {{ price }} to {{ price | usd }} in quoted.html, it worked.
sorry i'm kinda afk and shit at the moment
david232323

Today at 4:36 PM
I removed the places where I used the usd() and only used | usd. Tho it still gives me the attribute error for not having upper
I mean I have everything like you did, but nothing works
This shitty check50 is just being a massive redudnant
