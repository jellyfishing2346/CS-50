              Dartmouth's root system weaves through many pivotal moments in the history of the United States.
              Founded in 1769, the College has shaped the education landscape and prepared generations of leaders to
              advance industries, societies, and cultures.
              Dartmouth's founder, Eleazar Wheelock, a Congregational minister from Connecticut,
              established the College "for the education and instruction of youth of the Indian tribes in this land...
              English Youth, and any others." Samson Occom, a Mohegan Indian and one of Wheelock's first students,
              was instrumental in raising the funds necessary to found the College.

                The Dartmouth Center for Social Impact is the College's first stop for all service-related activities.
                With a number of available off-campus internships, any free term can be used to embark on a life-changing experience.
                And since the Center provides funding for students to initiate projects on their own, the possibilities are limitless.
                In the local area, they offer six different pre-existing programs, giving students the invaluable
                opportunity to work with schools and community organizations within the region.
                For those who are interested in social-sector careers, the Center offers conferences with alumni and
                distinguished panelists to build connections and pass on knowledge to new generations.
                But that isn't all; the Center for Social Impact is adding new programs and activities based on student interest,
                so stay tuned.

              A student by the name of Adrian Chimboza recommends this place.
              Adrian: "As a passionate gamer, I didn’t know how I was going to survive at Dartmouth for four years without
               getting intimate with a game controller. After finishing a week’s worth of classes, I needed something
               to take my mind off school. I had to look everywhere on campus for a place where I could just chill and
               play video games and that’s how I found The Onion. After going there numerous times to hang out with some friends,
               it became my happy place. So, if you’re a gamer by any chance, with an unmatchable love for video games,
               just know that Dartmouth has you covered".
               Definitely worth checking out.
