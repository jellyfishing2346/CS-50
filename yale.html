            Yale has grown and evolved for 300-plus years,
            passing many milestones and forging traditions along the way.
            The university traces its roots to the 1640s,
            when colonial clergymen led an effort to establish a local college
            in the tradition of European liberal education.
            In 1701 the Connecticut legislature adopted a charter
            “to erect a Collegiate School.”
            The school officially became Yale College in 1718, when it was renamed in
            honor of Welsh merchant Elihu Yale, who had donated the proceeds from the sale
            of nine bales of goods together with 417 books and a portrait of King George I.
            Take a stroll through Yale’s three centuries of history, and learn about the
            traditions that have become part of the fabric of our university.

              of a shop and purchased him from a New Haven blacksmith for $5.

             Yale’s connections to the military have been long-standing.
             Yale President Ezra Stiles led more than half of the student body
             to take on the overwhelming Redcoat troops in 1779 when the largest flotilla ever to enter
             Long Island Sound attacked New Haven. Twenty-five Yale graduates served as Generals for the
             Union Army during the Civil War, and almost 9,500 Yale graduates and students served in World War I.
             During World War II, the campus was largely given over to the military, and over 20,000 soldiers,
             sailors and marines were trained on campus at Yale.
             In addition to basic training, Yale hosted the Army Specialized Training Program, the Navy’s V-12 program,
             the Army Air Forces Technical Training School and a Military Intelligence School.
